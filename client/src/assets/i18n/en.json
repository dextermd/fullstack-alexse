The absence of equipment failures allows our customers to work profitably, without the cost of downtime, repairs or the purchase of new scales.<br>Many enterprises in Moldova, Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan have been successfully using scales manufactured by Alex S&E for more than 25 years. Our products are used in warehouses, metal warehouses, reinforced concrete products, mining and processing plants, elevators, quarries, at temporary points, for example, in the manufacture of roads, to control the axle load and, accordingly, the load on the roadbed.<br>At Alex S&E you can always buy a scale for weighing trucks at the best price.
