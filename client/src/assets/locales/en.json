Weighing of wagons on scales practically eliminates losses when accounting for products.<br>For more than 27 years, Alex S&E has been producing and modernizing rail scales with European, Russian and combined gauge, for weighing all types of wagons with or without decoupling. The dimensions, type and equipment of the scales may differ depending on the tasks, place of installation and wagons to be weighed.<br>The software supplied with the scales will serve as an irreplaceable assistant to the operator or will allow the vehicle to be weighed in automatic mode, without the operator's participation, which will eliminate human errors.<br>When designing and manufacturing scales, we pay great attention to the reliability and quality of products. The absence of equipment failures allows our customers to work profitably, without the cost of downtime, repairs or the purchase of new scales.<br>Many enterprises in Moldova, Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan have been successfully using scales manufactured by Alex S&E for more than 25 years. Our products are used in warehouses, metal warehouses, reinforced concrete products, mining and processing plants, elevators, quarries, at temporary points, for example, in the manufacture of roads, to control the axle load and, accordingly, the load on the roadbed.<br>At Alex S&E you can always buy a scale for weighing trucks at the best price.

Every day, more and more managers understand that automation is the key to the successful development of a company. Alex S&E develops and implements software for the automation of enterprises in various fields of activity. The software offered by Alex S&E is reliable and versatile. For more than 27 years, software products created and implemented by the company's specialists have been used in trade and industrial enterprises, in medical centers and hospitals, spa centers, fitness clubs, hotels, restaurants, bars, canteens, for warehouse accounting and management of balances. The automation of any enterprise is a system that works in concert with hardware and software. When automating the entire technological process, a person performs only an observation function, and, therefore, risks associated with the human factor are excluded as much as possible. Automation allows you to combine all divisions of the enterprise into a single, well-coordinated mechanism. Personnel management, control of product leftovers in the sales area, warehouse or at different stages of production, sidki, planning, reservation, reporting and analytics - these are the few things that enterprise automation gives.<br>Today, automation of any enterprise is no longer a luxury, but a guarantee of the company's productive work. The right choice of software and hardware will maximize results and minimize the cost of implementing automation systems. Thanks to their experience, Alex S&E specialists will help you find the best solution that suits your business.<br>"
